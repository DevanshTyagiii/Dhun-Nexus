> GitHub for Music Stems × Real-Time Jam Rooms × Bounty Marketplace  
Built for the Indian Independent Creator Economy.

## 🚀 Vision

DhunNexus is a stem-first social collaboration platform designed for bedroom producers, vocalists, instrumentalists, and regional creators.

Unlike streaming platforms, DhunNexus treats **the stem as the atomic unit of music** — enabling forking, layering, merging, and real-time collaboration.

We are building the infrastructure layer for India’s next music wave.
